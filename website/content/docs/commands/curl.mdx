# Command: curl

The curl command allows easy access to Nomad's HTTP API similar to the popular
[curl] program. Nomad's curl command reads [environment variables][envvars] to
dramatically ease HTTP API access compared to trying to manually write the same
command with the third party `curl` command.

For example for the following environment:

```
NOMAD_TOKEN=d4434353-c797-19e4-a14d-4068241f86a4
NOMAD_CACERT=$HOME/.nomad/ca.pem
NOMAD_CLIENT_CERT=$HOME/.nomad/cli.pem
NOMAD_CLIENT_KEY=$HOME/.nomad/client-key.pem
NOMAD_TLS_SERVER_NAME=client.global.nomad
NOMAD_ADDR=https://remote.client123.internal:4646
```

Accessing Nomad's [`/v1/metrics`][metrics] HTTP endpoint with `nomad curl`
would require:

```
nomad curl /v1/metrics
```

Performing the same request using the external `curl` tool would require:

```
curl \
  --cacert "$HOME/.nomad/ca.pem" \
  --cert "$HOME/.nomad/client.pem" \
  --key "$HOME/.nomad/client-key.pem" \
  --connect-to "client.global.nomad:4646:remote.client123.internal:4646" \
  -H "X-Nomad-Token: ${NOMAD_TOKEN}" \
  https://client.global.nomad:4646/v1/metrics
```

The `-dryrun` flag for `nomad curl` will output a curl command instead of
performing the HTTP request immediately. Note that you do *not* need the 3rd
party `curl` command installed to use `nomad curl`. The `curl` output from
`-dryrun` is intended for use in scripts or running in locations without a
Nomad binary present.
